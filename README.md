# -Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project is a heart disease prediction model that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various factors.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib

## Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/heart-disease-prediction.git
```
Once cloned, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Usage
To use the heart disease prediction model, simply run the Jupyter Notebook named heart-disease-prediction.ipynb. This notebook contains all the code necessary to train the model and make predictions on new data.
